# Universal Basic Income Tax Spreadsheet for New Zealand

Model a New Zealand Universal Basic Income funded through income taxes
and savings form current social spending. 

This spreadsheet uses the method for modelling changes to personal tax rates described on [this page](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/revenue/estimatesrevenueeffects/personal) at the New Zealand Treasury.


## Features

  - Set income rates for the current tax brackets and an optional 
    $150000+ bracket.
  - Set Adult and Child Universal Basic Incomes and populations.
  - Get individual bet income, real tax rates, and difference from status
    quoe for gross personal incomes up to $250000.
  - Get Government Revenue estimates from the changes, and balance them
    against savings.
  - Automatically adjusts savings from the pension based on the adult UBI to
    keep pensioners income at the current level. (Or you can override it).


## Disclaimer

I'm not qualified in anything related to this stuff. Actually it's
worse, I'm a computer programmer and we're supposed to be better than
spreadsheets.

UBI are a way bigger change for this model to take into account of all
the effects. It's really just there to give an idea how it would be
affordable.

If you know stats or economics or whatever, feel free to tell me what I've 
done wrong.  

Pull requests welcome.
